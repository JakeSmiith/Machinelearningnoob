#Interest rate data - 10 year Treasury yield > Fed funds rate 
#Rationale - Short-term volatility in Fed funds rate as traders aim to rebalance portfolios. 

#Treasury yield > Breakeven rate: Could indicate expectations for real economic growth without significant inflationary pressures.
#Treasury yield ≈ Breakeven rate: Suggests that most of the yield is being eroded by inflation expectations, indicating the market anticipates little real growth.
#Treasury yield < Breakeven rate: This is rare but could signal stagflationary conditions, where inflation expectations outpace growth expectations.
#Having both variables enables your model to understand not only the level of interest rates and inflation expectations but also their relative dynamics
