To do (@ bb terminal)
- Remove 'US Equity' from constituent list
- Link up the constituent list into a loop when fetching data from alphavantage
- Or I could just do this all in BB terminal? 
- Why don't I grab all stock-related data from bb terminal?
- Still need to loop and perform action for all S&P500 constituents.
