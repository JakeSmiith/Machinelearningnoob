To do (@ bb terminal)
- Remove 'US Equity' from constituent list
- Link up the constituent list into a loop when fetching data from alphavantage
- Or I could just do this all in BB terminal? 
- Why don't I grab all stock-related data from bb terminal?
- Still need to loop and perform action for all S&P500 constituents.



- Later considerations (once we have the data) - How do we split up into training and testing data? 

# What's the end goal - RMSE model
# Idea - Create interface which allows dropdown menu - macro outlook with infl
Dashboard whgich shows historical growth on website
